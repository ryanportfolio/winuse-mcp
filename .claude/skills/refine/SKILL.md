# refine: post-task harness pass

The harness (skills, reference, memory, kernel) is state you can edit. When a task ends, mine the trajectory for friction and apply the smallest evidence-backed edit that would have prevented it. Self-improvement means explicit, persisted, reversible edits, never vague intent.

## Step 1: Mine the trajectory

Re-read this session's actual events, not your summary of them. List every friction event under these classes:

| Class | Symptom in trajectory | Edit surface |
|---|---|---|
| Rediscovery | Tool calls burned re-learning a fact no file records | The repo's durable notes: `.claude/reference/` via recall where both exist, else the always-loaded instruction file |
| Skill misfire | A skill fired and the user backed you out, or the right skill never fired | That skill's `description:` line |
| Correction | User corrected your process | The always-loaded instruction file (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, equivalent), only if no rule exists |
| Stale state | A reference or memory entry proved wrong during the task | Replace or delete the entry |

Mine through three lenses, in order, so one reading style doesn't hide a friction class: judgment (wrong calls, missed checks, corrections), tooling (calls wasted on work a script, permission, or recorded fact would have skipped), divergent (what would a session that took a different approach have avoided; which friction repeats across sessions, not just here).

Read the surface before editing it. This skill installs globally, so the repo in front of you may have none of the files named above.

Completion bar: every user correction and every backed-out action in the trajectory is either listed as friction or explicitly ruled out with a reason.

## Step 2: Smallest edit per friction

- One friction → one smallest edit → one commit. The commit message quotes the trajectory evidence. The commit is the rollback snapshot. Stage only the harness files that edit touched; the task's own in-flight work never rides along.
- If a code or config change would remove the friction outright, propose that instead of documenting the workaround. A note telling the next session to pass a flag is worse than the flag being unnecessary.
- Structural enforcement check, before any prose edit lands: a rule a lint, hook, script, or permission entry can enforce beats prose stating it. Prefer the structural encoding; if it's too big for this pass, note it as the follow-up instead of writing the prose rule.
- A skill that misfired is a description bug, not a one-off judgment error. Judgment executes descriptions; fix the trigger surface. Where writing-skills exists it governs the edit and its test loop applies. Without it, still verify: hand a fresh subagent the descriptions plus the scenario that misfired, confirm it now routes correctly, and confirm a neighbouring scenario does not over-fire.
- Where recall exists, rediscoveries route through it and its format and commit rules apply.
- A correction whose rule already exists → no edit. Attention failure is not a documentation gap; duplicating the rule weakens the kernel.
- Edits landing outside a git repo (global skills, memory files) have no commit standing behind them. Name what you changed and where, so it can be reversed by hand.
- Zero edits is a valid outcome. Say so and stop.

## Red flags

- "One-off judgment error" about a skill misfire → it is a description bug; fix it.
- Several frictions bundled into one commit → rollback granularity lost.
- New kernel rule for something area-specific → reference file instead. Repo has no reference file → create one or accept the kernel line, but do not stall.
- An edit without quoted evidence → not evidence-backed; don't make it.
