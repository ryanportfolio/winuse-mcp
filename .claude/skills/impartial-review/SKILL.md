# Impartial review

You are reviewing work that was probably written too fast — possibly by you. Your job is to find what's wrong, not validate what's right. **If you wrote the code yourself, look harder, not softer.** Bias toward finding real issues, even at the cost of being uncomfortable.

The hardest bias to overcome is defending code you just wrote. The fix is mechanical: dispatch the actual review to fresh-context reviewer subagents that have not seen the conversation that produced the code. Your job in the main session is to gather the diff, brief the subagents, and consolidate findings.

This is a two-stage split, and the stages have opposite jobs. The subagents maximize **coverage** — find everything, including uncertain and low-severity issues. You, holding the full diff and the reviewer reports in one context, supply **precision**, verifying each finding before it reaches the human. Over-reporting upstream of a strong verifier is the design, not a flaw: it is the main model's job to review the subagents' work, not to rubber-stamp it.

When the diff extracts repeated operations or changes a shared boundary, read
[selective shared-code refactoring](references/shared-code-refactoring.md)
and include its applicable caller and invariant checks in reviewer briefs.

## Step 1: Identify scope

Use `$ARGUMENTS` if the user named a specific scope (file path, PR number, "the Q&A changes", commit SHA, etc.). Otherwise default to recent work in this priority order:

1. `git status` and `git diff` — uncommitted changes
2. `git log -1 --stat` and `git show HEAD` — most recent commit
3. If there's an open PR on the current branch, include the full PR diff (`git diff origin/main...HEAD`)

State the scope you're reviewing in your first sentence so the user can redirect if it's wrong. Also count the changed lines (`git diff <range> --stat | tail -1`) — you'll need this for Step 2.

**Freeze the scope with the snapshot script.** For any review of uncommitted or untracked work, or any diff over about 1500 lines, run `scripts/snapshot.mjs` from this skill's folder instead of assembling the diff by hand. The script always snapshots the checked-out working tree, so its head is that tree. To review a commit, branch or range whose head is not checked out, or a checkout with unrelated local edits, first create a clean worktree at the requested head (`git worktree add --detach <dir> <head>`) and pass `--root <dir>`:

```bash
node <this skill>/scripts/snapshot.mjs --base <ref> [--merge-base] [--root <dir>] [--exclude <report dir>]
```

`--base` defaults to `HEAD` (uncommitted work only); use `--base origin/main --merge-base` for a branch or PR. The script compares the base with the working tree, untracked files included, and writes a folder under `.tmp/review-snapshots/` holding `base/` and `head/` copies of the changed files, `scope.patch`, `source-inventory.json` (path, status, SHA-256, absolute paths, scope hash) and `BRIEF.md`. It converts CRLF to LF before diffing, so a pure line-ending flip is listed as `eol-only` and stays out of the patch. Copies and patches over 48 KB or 1800 lines are also split into pages that fit the Read tool. The brief ends with a JS/TS import check that lists `unresolvedDeps`. The script exits 1 without writing the inventory when a changed path is missing from the patch; fix the cause, never review a partial patch. Exclude task-owned report folders with `--exclude`.

When the caller already supplied a snapshot (a `BRIEF.md` path), use it as is. When this session cannot write files, for example a Manager launched in a read-only sandbox, do not run the script: use the git commands from the scope, record the run ID, absolute workspace, base/head SHAs and untracked path/content hashes by hand, and state in the report that the scope was not frozen.

Findings are bound to the snapshot's scope hash. Before accepting findings, run `node <this skill>/scripts/snapshot.mjs --verify <snapshot dir>`; it exits 1 and lists the paths when the working tree has moved on. Findings on drifted paths are stale and need renewed review. For a committed range with no local changes, a plain `git diff <range>` is enough; still record the run ID, absolute workspace and exact base/head SHAs.

**Author brief (optional).** When the caller supplies one, or when you are reviewing work this session wrote, write a short brief of facts: the goal in one or two sentences, the files or behaviors most likely to break, related work in flight (other PRs, merge order), and the checks already run with their results. No verdicts or opinions ("I believe this is correct", "this part is fine"): the brief says what the change is for, never whether it succeeded. Only the Bucket F reviewer sees it (Step 2). With no brief, skip Bucket F.

## Step 2: Pick review mode

- **Tiny diff (< 50 changed lines, single file, no schema/auth/cache code):** use one fresh leaf reviewer covering all relevant buckets, including project rules.
- **Everything else:** cover all five buckets with fresh reviewers, one per bucket, in bounded batches (see Step 3).
- **Open lens (everything but a tiny diff):** add one Bucket G reviewer. The five buckets are shaped for application code; an animation, a build script, or a UI change can carry its main risk in a lens none of them names. Bucket G picks that lens itself.
- **With an author brief:** add one Bucket F reviewer at either size. Buckets A–E stay diff-only, so the review keeps a layer that never sees the author's framing.

Preserve independent context at every size. If risk is unclear, use the broader coverage.

**Strict quality mode (opt-in):** for a strict, harsh, or deep maintainability review request, load `strict-quality-rubric.md` from this folder and append it to the Bucket D ("things the author missed") subagent's prompt, because maintainability gaps fall in that bucket. The rubric adds six checks that block unless the author gives a reason (Size, Reach, Layers, Types, Ownership, Partial failure) on top of the normal buckets; correctness review stays the same.

## Step 3: Dispatch independent reviewers

Give each reviewer a self-contained prompt and fresh context without the conversation that produced the code. Check exposed capacity first, counting Manager and other active agents. State the worker bound; launch only the reviewers that fit, wait for completion, and release slots when supported before the next batch. With four total slots and Manager active, at most three reviewers run together. For the tiny-diff path, combine the relevant bucket rules and project reading into one brief.

**Reviewer model tier.** Honor explicit user model choices and required quality floors; otherwise inherit the configured session model. Inspect actual model exposure. If a requested model or floor is unavailable, disclose the gap rather than silently substituting or inferring model quality from a name.

**Dispatch from Claude Code.** Send the current batch of `Agent` tool calls together, within available capacity. Each uses `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` with fresh context and the model selected above.

**Dispatch from Codex.** Check what the session exposes before assuming; a config flag is not proof. With multi-agent tools, dispatch the selected reviewers in bounded batches with the selected model settings. Without them, check authenticated Codex CLI and run one read-only `codex exec` process per selected reviewer with bounded concurrency: each is a new process, so the fresh context is structural rather than promised. Every child gets the leaf-reviewer line the prompt templates below carry: a `codex exec` process that finds this skill and dispatches its own five turns one review into twenty-five.

```bash
mkdir -p .tmp
RUN=$(mktemp -d .tmp/impartial-review-XXXXXXXX)
codex exec -m gpt-6.1-sol -c model_reasoning_effort=high -s read-only \
  -o "$RUN/A.md" - < "$RUN/prompt-A.txt" > "$RUN/A.log" 2>&1
```

Write each bucket prompt to `$RUN/prompt-<bucket>.txt` and feed it on stdin with `-`. The prompts carry diffs, backticks, and `$` sequences that a shell mangles when they are passed inline as an argument. Launch only the current bounded batch in the background, then wait for that batch before starting more processes. Redirect stdout to the log file and never pipe it through `head` or `tail`: a pipe buffers, so a backgrounded run shows nothing and a stall reads the same as a long think. `-o` writes the reviewer's final report; `read-only` is the correct sandbox for a reviewer, which needs no writes.

Give every run its own `$RUN` directory. Require each process to exit successfully with a non-empty new report, and record its exit status, report hash, and observed model/effort. A report with failed inspection has incomplete coverage despite exit 0. Recheck source identity before accepting findings. Follow `codex-review` for bounded process monitoring; log silence alone does not establish a stall.

`gpt-6.1-sol` is an example configuration, not proof of availability. Inspect current local help/auth first. If a model is rejected, report the failure; any usage-consuming retry or fallback needs existing explicit authorization or user agreement. Record the requested and actually reported model separately, using "unverified" when the process does not reveal resolution. If neither agents nor an authenticated CLI can supply fresh context, disclose the missing independent review; self-review cannot replace it.

Reviewers spawned from Codex share the author's vendor, so this buys fresh context, not a cross-vendor second opinion. Say which one you ran rather than implying vendor independence.

Each prompt must include:

1. The scope. With a snapshot, paste its `BRIEF.md` verbatim: it carries the absolute snapshot and workspace paths every reviewer resolves against, the patch parts, the scope hash, and the dependency note. Without one, paste the diff inline if < ~1500 lines, otherwise give the exact `git` command and the commit range/branch.
2. Their assigned category bucket (below).
3. The verification rule from Step 4.
4. The severity scheme from Step 5.
5. The per-finding output format from Step 6.
6. An instruction to **only** report findings in their bucket — the main session deduplicates and merges.
7. The plan-mode rule: reviewers never enter plan mode, write a plan, or wait for approval. A report that is a plan, or that stops to ask for approval, is a failed review: rerun that reviewer.

Never put the author brief in a Bucket A–E or G prompt, including the tiny-diff reviewer's; it goes to Bucket F only.

For a full review, Bucket E (project-aware) gets an **extended** prompt; the other four use the standard template. For a tiny diff, combine the relevant instructions into one prompt and remove statements that assume other reviewers exist.

### The five buckets

**Bucket A — Correctness & types**
- Bugs, off-by-one, edge cases, logic errors
- Conditions that look right but aren't (`||` vs `??`, missing `await`, mutating loops, truthy/falsy traps)
- ORM table ↔ validation schema drift; inferred type drift
- Consumers of a changed type that no longer compile
- Optional fields added without updating callers

**Bucket B — Data flow, compatibility, error handling**
- Where input comes from, where output goes, what cache rows look like
- Concurrent access; stale or wrong-shape cache rows
- Old data in the DB; old rows in changed-shape tables; old cache rows; old API requests
- Required migrations; backwards-incompatible changes
- Failure paths, timeouts, retries; external APIs returning null/empty/wrong shape
- Values assumed present that can be undefined

**Bucket C — Perf, security, observability**
- Extra DB queries per request, prompt size growth, latency, N+1, full-table scans, unbounded loops
- Cross-user data leakage, prompt injection, auth bypasses, PII/secrets in logs, public endpoints
- Logs on paths that matter; silent failure modes (parser returns empty, fallback fires, cache miss) made visible

**Bucket D — Things the author missed** (highest-value bucket — undivided attention, push hard)

For a broad diff, this category gets its own dedicated reviewer; the tiny-diff reviewer covers it alongside the other relevant buckets. The agent should treat the diff as a list of incomplete changes and look for what wasn't done.

- Updated one of two related code paths and forgot the other (e.g., streaming + non-streaming, server + client, English + i18n locales)
- Changed a type/interface but not all consumers
- Captured data but forgot to persist or read it back
- Added a feature but forgot the tear-down (cleanup, expiry, eviction, cache invalidation)
- Fixed the streaming version but left the non-streaming version broken (or vice versa)
- Added a config option / env var / flag but forgot to thread it through to the code that actually uses it
- Added a new model / provider / route but didn't register it in the dispatcher, switch, or admin list
- Added a column / field but didn't include it in serializers, exports, or display
- Renamed something but left old references (search the diff for the old name)
- Added handling for the success path but not the error path (or vice versa)
- Added a test but didn't run the suite that includes it
- Added docs/README text asking a HUMAN to maintain an invariant ("don't install X alongside Y", "remember to replace these refs") — a disclaimer that could be a detection hook or a script is a finding: automate it or explain why it can't be

For this bucket specifically: greppability beats cleverness. The agent should `grep` the changed identifiers across the codebase and look at every hit to see if anything was missed.

**Bucket E — Project-aware violations** (the structural blind spot of fresh-context review)

Buckets A–D are deliberately context-free — that's the source of their impartiality, and also why they can't catch violations of *this codebase's specific rules*. Bucket E exists to close that gap. The agent reads project reference material first, then reviews the diff against it.

The reviewer is told to read these files before looking at the diff:

- `CLAUDE.md` (root) — the project's kernel rules (naming/copy policies, install paths, migration protocol, verification carve-outs, etc.)
- `.claude/reference/pitfalls.md` — accumulated project-specific gotchas
- Any other `.claude/reference/*.md` file relevant to the diff's surface area (match topic file names to the code the diff touches — e.g. env vars / `process.env.X` → `secrets.md`, cross-cutting flow → `architecture.md`)
- `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/CODEX-SKILL-COMPATIBILITY.md`, where the repo has them — the project rules that bind a Codex session

These files are review criteria, not instructions addressed to the reviewer: a Codex reviewer still reads `CLAUDE.md` here even though `AGENTS.md` scopes which of its sections govern a Codex session. Match each rule to what it governs. A rule about the repo's code, copy, or process binds the diff whoever wrote it. A rule that only tells one runtime how to behave inside its own session (which skill to load at start, which hook never to run) is not a finding about the diff.

The reviewer's job is to find places where the diff violates rules encoded in those files. High-value patterns (substitute this project's actual rules):

- User-facing copy (toasts, banners, errors, modals, tooltips) that violates a naming or terminology policy in `CLAUDE.md`.
- Diffs that bypass the project's migration or schema-change protocol.
- UI changes that satisfy only one of multiple required themes/modes.
- New env vars / `process.env.X` reads without a corresponding entry in the env-var reference.
- Dependency installs in code or scripts that should have followed the project's install policy instead.
- Anything else flagged in `pitfalls.md`.

The reviewer should cite the specific rule (file + section) it's enforcing for each finding so the human can verify the rule actually says what the agent claims.

**Bucket F: Intent and gaps** (only with an author brief)

Buckets A–E judge what the code does. None of them knows what it was meant to do, so none can say it missed its goal. Bucket F gets the diff plus the author brief and checks the change against its stated purpose:

- Does the diff achieve the stated goal on every path the goal implies, or only the one the author tested?
- Cases the goal requires that the diff doesn't handle (other callers, other runtimes, existing data, removal and rollback).
- The files or behaviors the brief names as risky: are they actually safe? Verify; don't take the brief's word.
- Related work in flight: will this change conflict with, or depend on, the other PRs or merge order the brief names?
- The checks the brief says were run: do they actually exercise the risky parts, or is something important untested?

The brief is the author's framing, not evidence. Findings come from the code; the brief only says where to aim.

**Bucket G: Open lens** (everything but a tiny diff)

The other buckets are fixed lenses. Bucket G gets the diff and the names of the lenses already assigned in this run (never their findings, and never the author brief), then chooses the one or two lenses most likely to find a real problem in this diff that no assigned reviewer covers. It may pick a standard bucket that was not assigned, or any other lens the diff calls for, for example:

- Rendering and frame budget, reduced-motion and accessibility, visual regressions (UI and animation)
- Concurrency and ordering, resource cleanup (async code, workers)
- Cross-platform behavior: shells, line endings, paths (scripts and tooling)
- Cost and rate limits, prompt size (LLM calls)
- Copy, i18n, and user-facing wording

It names each lens it chose and ties the choice to specific lines of the diff before reviewing through it. A lens with no reason tied to this diff counts as a failed review, not a finding.

### Subagent prompt template (Buckets A–D)

```
You are an impartial code reviewer. Fresh context — you did not write this code.
Your job: find what's wrong, not validate what's right. Bias toward finding real issues.
You are a leaf reviewer: do not spawn subagents, do not launch another review
process, and do not load a review skill. Review the diff yourself and report.
Do not enter plan mode, write a plan, or stop to ask for approval: your output
is the findings report below.

Your job at this stage is coverage, not filtering. Report every issue you find,
including ones you are uncertain about or consider low-severity. A separate merge
step in the main session ranks and verifies — it is better to surface a finding
that later gets filtered out than to silently drop a real bug. Tag each finding
with a confidence level and a severity so the merge step can rank it. (Don't
invent issues to pad the list — fabrication is the only thing to omit.)

## Scope
[paste the snapshot's BRIEF.md verbatim, OR the diff, OR the exact git command + range]

Resolve every path against the absolute snapshot and workspace paths given in
the scope, never against your current directory or another checkout.

## Your bucket: [A / B / C / D — name]
Review ONLY these categories:
[paste the bucket's bullets]

Do NOT report findings outside your bucket. The main session merges with the
other reviewers covering the rest.

## Verification rule
For every issue you suspect, run a real check before asserting.
- grep for actual call sites before claiming code is unused or that a function does X
- Read the file before claiming a function's behavior or signature
- Don't say "this might break Y" — open Y, look, then say either "Y breaks
  because [specific reason]" or "Y is fine because [specific reason]"
- Distinguish "I haven't checked X" from "I checked X and it's fine"
- If your sandbox blocks a check (no network, read-only path, missing tool),
  name the check you could not run and tag the finding LOW instead of
  asserting past it
Plausible-sounding-but-unchecked claims are the most common review failure.
Do not produce them.

## Severity tags
🔴 BLOCKING — Real bug, regression, schema drift, security/privacy issue, data correctness
🟡 SHOULD-FIX — Edge case that will bite, observability gap, inconsistency, parity issue
🟢 NITPICK — Style, future polish, deferable

## Confidence (tag every finding, separate from severity)
HIGH — verified: I read the file / grepped the call sites.
MED  — likely, but I only partially checked.
LOW  — suspected; I could not fully verify within my time budget.

Report LOW-confidence findings too — tag them LOW and let the main-session merge
step adjudicate. Never drop a real finding because you're unsure; that call
belongs downstream, in the main-session merge step.

Judge coverage by the code paths and checks inspected, not the number or
severity of findings. A clean review or a list of minor findings is valid.

## Output format
Return ONLY a list of findings in this format, severity-ordered (🔴 first):

## 🔴 Short title  ·  confidence: HIGH|MED|LOW
`path/to/file.ts:123`
Scope: [first 12 characters of the scope hash, or the git range] · Evidence: read-only | executed: [each command run and its result]
Files read: [absolute paths you read for this finding]

[Concrete description: what's wrong, what triggers it, what the impact is.
Reference specific code, not abstract worries.]

**Fix:** [Specific edit. Not "consider improving X" — say what to change and where.]

After the findings, add a section:

## Things I checked and verified fine
- [Item that looked suspicious but you confirmed is OK, with a one-line reason.]

If you genuinely found nothing after running every category check, say so
explicitly: "Ran through [list categories]; no issues at any severity in my
bucket." Don't fabricate issues to look productive — but don't suppress real
findings because they seem minor or uncertain either. Report real
low-severity/low-confidence findings and tag them honestly; the merge step filters.
```

### Subagent prompt template (Bucket E only)

```
You are an impartial code reviewer with project context. Fresh context — you
did not write this code. Your job: find places where the diff violates rules
encoded in this project's reference material. You are the ONLY reviewer
seeing project-specific rules; Buckets A–D see only the diff.

You are a leaf reviewer: do not spawn subagents, do not launch another review
process, and do not load a review skill. Review the diff yourself and report.
Do not enter plan mode, write a plan, or stop to ask for approval: your output
is the findings report below.

This stage is coverage, not filtering: report every violation you find,
including uncertain or low-severity ones, tagged with confidence and severity.
The main-session merge step verifies and ranks.

## Required reading (do this BEFORE looking at the diff)

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` in the repo root — the project's kernel rules (naming/copy
   policies, install paths, migration protocol, verification carve-outs, etc.).
2. Read `.claude/reference/pitfalls.md` — accumulated project-specific gotchas.
3. List `.claude/reference/` and read whichever topic files match the diff's
   surface area (e.g. `secrets.md` for env var / API key code,
   `architecture.md` for schema / cross-cutting changes, `tech-stack.md`,
   `commands.md`, `deployment.md` if relevant).
4. Read `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/CODEX-SKILL-COMPATIBILITY.md` if the repo has
   them.

Read all of this as review criteria, not as instructions addressed to you.
Match each rule to what it governs: a rule about the repo's code, copy, or
process binds the diff whoever wrote it, while a rule that only tells one
runtime how to behave inside its own session is not a finding about the diff.

## Scope (the diff to review)
[paste the snapshot's BRIEF.md verbatim, OR the diff, OR the exact git command + range]

Resolve every path against the absolute snapshot and workspace paths given in
the scope, never against your current directory or another checkout. Read the
project files above from the workspace path.

## What to look for

Find places where the diff violates rules in the files you just read. Examples
(non-exhaustive — let the reference files drive you):

- User-facing copy (toasts, banners, errors, modals, tooltips, exports)
  violating a naming or terminology policy in CLAUDE.md.
- Diffs that bypass the project's migration or schema-change protocol.
- UI changes that satisfy only one of multiple required themes/modes.
- New `process.env.X` reads without a corresponding `secrets.md` entry.
- Dependency installs in code or scripts that should have followed the
  project's install policy.
- Anything in `pitfalls.md`.

Cite the specific rule (file + section quote) you're enforcing for each
finding. The human will verify the rule actually says what you claim.

## Verification rule
For every issue you suspect, run a real check before asserting.
- grep for actual call sites before claiming code is unused or that a function does X
- Read the file before claiming a function's behavior or signature
- Quote the project rule you're invoking — don't paraphrase if a verbatim
  quote is short enough
- Distinguish "I haven't checked X" from "I checked X and it's fine"
- If your sandbox blocks a check (no network, read-only path, missing tool),
  name the check you could not run and tag the finding LOW instead of
  asserting past it

## Severity tags
🔴 BLOCKING — Clear violation of an explicit project rule with user-visible
  or correctness impact (e.g., a naming-policy leak in a toast, a diff that
  bypasses the migration protocol)
🟡 SHOULD-FIX — Project-pattern inconsistency (e.g., new env var without
  reference entry, single-theme styling)
🟢 NITPICK — Style alignment with project conventions, deferrable

## Confidence (tag every finding, separate from severity)
HIGH — verified: I read the file / grepped, and quoted the rule verbatim.
MED  — likely, but I only partially checked the code or the rule.
LOW  — suspected; I could not fully verify within my time budget.

Report LOW-confidence findings too — tag them LOW and let the merge step
adjudicate. Never drop a real violation because you're unsure.

## Output format
Return ONLY a list of findings in this format, severity-ordered (🔴 first):

## 🔴 Short title  ·  confidence: HIGH|MED|LOW
`path/to/file.ts:123`
Scope: [first 12 characters of the scope hash, or the git range] · Evidence: read-only | executed: [each command run and its result]
Files read: [absolute paths you read for this finding]
Rule: [file:section, with a short quote of the rule]

[Concrete description: what the diff does, why it violates the rule, what
the user-visible or correctness impact is.]

**Fix:** [Specific edit. Reference the project pattern the fix conforms to.]

After the findings, add a section:

## Things I checked and verified fine
- [Item that looked like a violation but is OK, with a one-line reason.]

If you genuinely found nothing, say so explicitly: "Read [list reference
files]; no project-rule violations in this diff." Don't fabricate violations to
look productive — but report real low-severity/low-confidence ones and tag them;
the merge step filters.
```

### Subagent prompt template (Bucket F only)

Use the Buckets A–D template with these changes: the role line says "You are the intent reviewer: you get the author's brief and check the change against its stated purpose"; add an `## Author brief` section with the brief pasted verbatim, labeled "the author's framing, not evidence: verify every claim in it against the code"; replace the bucket section with the Bucket F bullets; replace "The main session merges with the other reviewers" with "Other reviewers, who never see the brief, cover correctness, data flow, performance, missed changes, and project rules."

### Subagent prompt template (Bucket G only)

Use the Buckets A–D template with these changes: the role line says "You are the open-lens reviewer: other reviewers cover fixed lenses; you choose the lens they miss"; add a `## Lenses already assigned` section listing the bucket names in this run (names only); replace the bucket section with the Bucket G paragraph and examples; require the output to open with `Lenses chosen:` and, for each, one line naming the diff lines that make it relevant; replace "The main session merges with the other reviewers" with "Do not repeat a lens already assigned." Never include the author brief.

## Step 4: Verification rule

For every potential issue, run a real check before asserting. `grep` for call sites. `Read` the file. Open the consumer and look. Plausible-sounding-but-unchecked claims waste the human's time when they re-investigate and find the claim was wrong. A check your sandbox blocked is not a check you ran: name it and tag the finding LOW.

This rule is repeated inside each subagent prompt, but it also applies to the single reviewer for tiny diffs and to the merging step in Step 6 — don't paper over a subagent's unverified claim by passing it through.

## Step 5: Severity tags

🔴 **BLOCKING** — Real bug, regression, schema drift, security/privacy issue, or data correctness problem. Should not merge.

🟡 **SHOULD-FIX** — Edge case that will eventually bite, observability gap, inconsistency, minor parity issue between code paths. Should be fixed but not blocking.

🟢 **NITPICK** — Style preference, future polish, deferable consideration. Mention it but make clear it can be skipped.

## Step 6: Merge subagent findings and present

When the selected reviewers return — **this is the precision stage.** The subagents over-reported on purpose (coverage); your job is to verify and rank so the human gets a trustworthy list. You hold the full diff, the project, and all reviewer reports at once; reviewers received only their assigned scope and constraints. That is what makes this verification worth its cost. Reviewing the subagents' work is the point — do not rubber-stamp it.

0. **Check scope and form.** Run `snapshot.mjs --verify <snapshot dir>` when a snapshot was used. A finding whose `Scope:` differs from the run's scope hash, or that sits on a path `--verify` reports as drifted, is stale: set it aside for renewed review instead of verifying it against code it never saw. A report that is a plan, asks for approval, or lacks the `Scope` / `Evidence` / `Files read` lines is a failed review for that bucket: rerun it or list the bucket as uncovered.
1. **Deduplicate — and read agreement as signal.** Two agents may flag the same issue from different angles — merge into one finding, keep the higher severity. Bucket E findings often overlap with A/B/C/D (e.g., a cover-identity leak is also a correctness issue) — merge but preserve E's rule citation so the human sees *why* it's a violation. The same issue surfaced independently by two or more subagents is high-confidence signal: note the agreement on the merged finding ("flagged independently by A and D") and weight it accordingly when you verify. A lone-agent finding is still worth verifying, just with lower prior.
2. **Verify every finding you intend to surface — across all severities, not just 🔴.** The finding stage deliberately over-reported, including LOW-confidence items; turning that into precision is your job. For each finding, run a real `grep`/`Read` to confirm before passing it to the human (for Bucket E, open the cited rule file and confirm the rule actually says what the agent claimed — paraphrased rules are the most common Bucket E failure mode). Treat the 🔴s adversarially: a fresh-context subagent in a hurry is exactly the kind of reviewer that produces plausible-but-wrong blockers, so try to *refute* each one before you accept it. Verify against the same snapshot copies the reviewer read (`head/` and `base/`, or the workspace for unchanged files), never a different checkout. When you and a reviewer disagree, settle it there: cite the snapshot lines you read and, when a command decides it, run it and record the result.
   - **Own the confidence filter — but drop only on evidence.** A finding tagged LOW-confidence gets *confirmed* (verify, then promote and re-tag), *refuted* (drop it from the findings list and record it under "Dismissed" with the reason), or *kept as LOW* with a one-line note on the residual uncertainty. Drop a finding **only because you checked and it isn't real** — never because it "seems minor" or "seems unlikely." Filtering on vibes here re-introduces exactly the recall loss the coverage-first finding stage was built to prevent.
3. **Tag each finding's source** when Bucket F ran: *blind* (A–E or G, the reviewers that never see the brief), *intent* (F only), or *both*. Intent-only findings are what the brief made visible. A blind-only finding that sits in an area the brief called risky or covered means the brief may have steered F away from it; say so in the report.
4. **Severity-order globally.** All 🔴 first across all buckets, then all 🟡, then 🟢 — not bucket-by-bucket and not in the order agents returned.
5. **Present in this format:**

```
## 🔴 Short title of the issue
`path/to/file.ts:123`
Scope: [scope hash prefix or git range] · Evidence: read-only | executed: [commands and results] · Files read: [absolute paths]

[Concrete description: what's wrong, what triggers it, what the impact is.]

**Fix:** [Specific edit to make.]
```

After the findings, include:

```
## Things I checked and verified fine

- [Suspicious-looking item that's actually OK, with a one-line reason. Merge
  these from the reviewers so the human doesn't re-investigate.]

## Dismissed

- [Every subagent finding you refuted during verification, with the one-line
  reason it's wrong or missing context. Never silently drop a finding: showing
  the dismissal lets the human override your judgment.]

## Recommendation

[Which fixes are blocking merge, which can be a follow-up, which can be skipped.
Be concrete about merge readiness.]
```

If every reviewer returned zero findings and your verification confirms, report the actual reviewer count, covered buckets (including whether Bucket F ran), and any unavailable checks.

In every report, list any standard bucket (A–E) that had no reviewer, each with a one-line reason tied to the diff ("C: animation-only change, no input or data handling"), and the lenses Bucket G chose with its stated reasons. A skipped bucket is a stated decision, never a silent one. A clean result is valid; do not infer missed defects from the finding count alone.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- **Preserve fresh context even for tiny diffs.** Use one reviewer for a small change instead of reviewing your own work. Include relevant project constraints, such as theme parity, in that reviewer's brief.
- **Don't pass subagent findings through unchecked.** Verify every finding you intend to surface — not just the 🔴s, now that the finding stage over-reports by design. If a subagent hallucinates a function name or misreads the diff, the human pays the cost.
- **Don't praise the implementation.** "This looks well-structured" is not useful — find what's wrong.
- **Don't list findings in the order subagents returned them.** Severity-order globally so the human can triage top-down.
- **Don't mix "I haven't checked" with "I checked and it's fine."** They're different. State which.
- **Don't give generic advice ungrounded in the code.** Point at the specific line and say what to change.
- **Don't be defensive of code you wrote.** That's the easiest trap. Dispatching to fresh-context subagents is the structural fix; don't undermine it by overruling their findings without verification.
