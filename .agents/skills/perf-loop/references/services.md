# Services and resources

## Comparable work

Record dataset size + shape, operation mix, arrival rate or client concurrency, connection pools, process count, warmup, cache hit/miss state. Representative fixtures; isolate write workloads. Default: local or approved test envs; prod load + destructive data changes need authorization.

Measure together: latency distributions w/ enough samples, completed useful ops per unit time, errors/timeouts. Count failed work in result. Lower latency from rejecting work or serving incomplete results = regression.

Check load generator not saturated. Record whether it sends at fixed arrival rate or waits for responses; waiting client lowers offered load during stalls → hides queuing delay (coordinated omission). Include queues + timed-out requests in interpretation. Compare at equal load before exploring capacity limits.

## Locate constraint

Traces + profiles → separate app CPU, queueing, locks, network, DB, disk. Inspect query count, execution plans, returned rows, payload only when they contribute to measured delay. Small fixture hides complaint → consider algorithmic scaling across representative data sizes.

Memory: distinguish peak, retained after idle/collection where observable, growth over repeated cycles. Compare equivalent lifecycle points. Allocation volume alone ≠ leak. Sustained scenario long enough to expose suspected behavior; state duration limitation.

Change could shift costs → measure CPU time, I/O volume, cache size, resource peaks. Faster responses via unbounded memory, more workers, or extra infra → explicit tradeoff + representative capacity measurements.

## Correctness under pressure

After caching, concurrency, query, or storage changes → verify relevant freshness, invalidation, permissions, ordering, pagination, cancellation, retries, transaction behavior. Preserve persistence + isolation guarantees. Include repeated ops + failure paths where change could alter them.

Record startup + steady-state effects. Confirm 1 faster endpoint hasn't pushed load onto a dependency or slowed another protected op. Scope perf conclusions to measured load + data distribution.
