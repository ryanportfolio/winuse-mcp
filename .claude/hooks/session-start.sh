# SessionStart hook
#
# Design principle: do work Claude can't do itself, surface things Claude can't
# otherwise see, and stay quiet about anything Claude can recompute on demand.
#
# CLOUD (CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true):
#   - Auto-rebase current branch onto origin/main (cloud sandbox is isolated,
#     safe to rewrite)
#   - Print the universal-skills reminder block
#
# Note: we deliberately do NOT cat CLAUDE.md here. Claude Code auto-loads it as
# project memory, and SessionStart only injects context via stdout/additionalContext
# (not stderr), so a stderr cat was redundant noise, not context injection.
#
# LOCAL (CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE unset):
#   - Read-only fetch from origin (prime the cache, no output)
#   - Print the universal-skills reminder block
#   - Never modify the working tree or any branch

# Retry a git fetch up to 4 times with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s, 16s).
# The cloud sandbox's local git proxy occasionally returns transient 503s;
# without retries, a single blip surfaces as a SessionStart hook error.
# Usage: fetch_with_retry <args to pass to git fetch...>

[SessionStart] ACTIVE SESSION DEFAULT: caveman ultra (per CLAUDE.md).
BEFORE your first reply, invoke the `caveman` skill at ultra intensity (Skill tool,
args: "ultra") and apply that style to ALL prose replies for the entire session:
terse, abbreviated, arrows for causality, full technical accuracy preserved. This
persists across this and every future session until the user says "stop caveman" /
"normal mode".
  - Prose only. Code, commits, PRs, file contents, and symbol/function/API/error
    strings stay normal and are never abbreviated.
  - Auto-clarity carve-outs: security warnings, irreversible-action confirmations,
    and ambiguous multi-step sequences drop to plain prose, then resume caveman.
