# Automate me

A guided flow for turning the user's working conventions into a skill agents will follow. The output is one `-mode` skill tailored to them (e.g. `ryan-mode`).

This skill orchestrates others: an inline mining pass (step 1), writing-skills plus addskill (authoring and repo install), and unslop (prose discipline). It sequences them; it doesn't replace them.

## Flow

### 0. Check for an existing skill

Look for `.claude/skills/*-mode/SKILL.md` in the repo and `~/.claude/skills/*-mode/` globally, matching the user's handle. If one exists, confirm intent (unless they already said "update my skill" or similar):

- Update the existing skill (default for repeat runs)
- Start fresh (rare; ask why before doing it)

Update mode changes the rest of the flow:
- Step 1 mines only history since the skill was last edited (`git log -1 --format=%cI <path>`).
- Step 2 asks what's changed or missing, not what to capture from zero.
- Step 4 edits the existing file in place. Preserve sections the user hasn't contradicted; revise ones with new evidence; add new sections only for genuinely new rules.

### 1. Mine their history

Locate the current project's transcripts before fanning out. Locally that is `~/.claude/projects/<munged-project-path>/` (the directory whose name encodes the project's absolute path); the project's auto-memory `MEMORY.md` under the same root is also evidence. Use only the current project's scope. Don't glob across other projects' directories: that crosses workspace boundaries and reads private chats from unrelated work. In a sandbox with no transcript access, say so and skip to step 2; questions plus CLAUDE.md and memory carry the draft.

Survey recent conversations for recurring patterns. Run parallel subagents across slices of history (e.g. last 2-4 weeks split into 3 slices so each has enough material). Each slice miner reads transcripts from the scoped path the parent provides, hunts the signals below, and returns a short structured list of patterns with evidence pointers. Default signals:

- Response preferences (length, tone, format, "dumb it down" corrections)
- Delegation habits (subagents, models, specialized workflows, parallelism)
- Verification posture (what "done" means; unit tests vs live repro; reviewers)
- Code and prose discipline (style, principles cited, lint/format tools)
- Process conventions (worktrees, commits, PRs, review/merge tooling)
- Meta preferences (fixing skills mid-task, proposing new ones)

Have each miner return **preference atoms**, not summaries: trigger, decision rule, quality bar, stop condition, evidence pointer, confidence. Rate confidence per atom: **strong** (explicit user preference, workflow-changing correction, repeated pattern, or direct request to encode behavior), **medium** (accepted workflow or repeated tool/validation preference), **weak** (agent-chosen behavior with no user feedback, or a likely task-specific correction), **contradicted** (evidence points in incompatible directions — ask the user before writing anything based on it).

Cross-check across slices before elevating a signal. Patterns seen in 2+ slices are high-confidence; lone signals are weak and usually get dropped. Contradicted atoms never get codified silently.

### 2. Ask the user directly

Mining misses intent that hasn't come up yet. Ask structured multi-choice questions rather than asking the user to type from scratch: lower cognitive load, higher hit rate.

Shape: one or two questions with 4-6 options each, multi-select for category questions. Start broad ("Which areas matter most?"), then follow up on selected areas with specific options. After the structured rounds, one free-form question catches anything the options missed.

Don't dump 20 questions. Two structured rounds plus one open question is usually enough.

### 3. Cluster findings

Group the combined signals into sections. Common ones (use only what applies):

- **Response style**: length, tone, format.
- **Autonomy**: how much to do without asking; tool use.
- **Understand first**: which skills to reach for when scoping or investigating.
- **Subagents**: default, parallelism, model-to-task, specialized workflows.
- **Prose / code discipline**: principles, lint tools, style guides.
- **Review and verify**: repro posture, verification skills, live-testing tools.
- **Process**: git worktrees, commits, PRs, review/merge tooling.
- **Skills**: skill-authoring habits, fix-the-skill-first, proposing new skills.

The fable-mode skill shows the output shape and granularity. Don't copy its content; the user's rules are not fable-mode's.

### 4. Draft the skill

Author via writing-skills; install via addskill (repo commit, Codex adapter, compatibility matrix).

- Path: `.claude/skills/<handle>-mode/SKILL.md` in the repo (required for cloud sessions), plus a global symlink if the user wants it machine-wide.
- Handle: the user's first name or chosen identifier.
- Frontmatter `description`: trigger on their name plus `/<handle>-mode` plus "work in their style" — not generic keywords like "write code" or "review PR". Mode skills are heavy and opinionated; they should fire on explicit invocation, not auto-trigger on loose description matching.

### 5. Iterate on prose

Apply unslop and writing-skills' guidelines to every line. Show the draft to the user and take feedback; expect multiple iterations. Cut ruthlessly: a mode skill is not a manual.

### 6. Land it

Work on a branch off freshly-fetched main. Commit and open a PR so the user can review it. Don't push to main directly.

## Guardrails

- **Don't overfit to one conversation.** A preference stated once and contradicted another time is noise. Require multiple instances before codifying.
- **Don't be clever.** Restating other skills' contents, inventing metaphors, or writing "poetic" prose for an agent reader is cost without benefit. Keep it operational.
- **Reference, don't inline.** Other skills the user relies on appear as path references, not pasted excerpts.
- **Keep sections minimal.** Only add a section if the user has a specific, non-default rule there. "Communicate clearly" is not a section. "Short paragraphs. Tables when comparing options." is.
- **Name conventions generic.** Use "the user" in imperatives, not the author's first name. Others may read or adopt the skill.
- **Don't force symmetry.** No process rules worth writing down means no Process section. Sparse is fine; bloated is not.

## Evaluation

A `-mode` skill is subjective output; a benchmark loop isn't useful here. Vibe-check with the user: does it read like them? Did it miss anything? Then ship. Run a description-optimization loop only if trigger accuracy proves a problem in practice.

## When not to use

- User wants a task-specific skill (not working conventions): writing-skills plus addskill alone, no mining.
- User wants one narrow workflow captured ("how I write commit messages"): a regular skill, not a mode skill.
