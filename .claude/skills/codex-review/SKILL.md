# Codex review — cross-vendor second opinion

Codex CLI runs on the user's ChatGPT/Codex subscription and ships a purpose-built non-interactive review mode: `codex exec review`. This skill drives it as an independent reviewer — a different model family that did not write the code and shares none of this session's context — then applies the same precision stage as `impartial-review`: every finding gets verified here before it reaches the human. No API key; billing rides the user's subscription.

Complementary to `impartial-review` (fresh-context Claude subagents): use that for bucketed multi-agent coverage, this for a cross-vendor opinion. They compose — run both on high-stakes diffs.

## Step 1: Preflight

```bash
codex --version && codex login status
```

Expect `Logged in using ChatGPT`. Not logged in → STOP and ask the user to run `codex login` (browser OAuth) in their own terminal. Never handle credentials yourself.

## Step 2: Identify scope

Use `$ARGUMENTS` if the user named a scope; otherwise infer from recent work. Map to the matching `codex exec review` selector:

| Scope | Selector |
|---|---|
| Uncommitted work (staged + unstaged + untracked) | `--uncommitted` |
| Branch / PR diff | `--base origin/<default-branch>` |
| Single commit | `--commit <SHA>` |

For `--base`, fetch first (`git fetch origin <default-branch>`) and pass the **remote-tracking ref** (`origin/main`, not `main`) — fetch updates only the remote-tracking ref, so a local branch name can silently compare against a stale base. State the scope in your first sentence so the user can redirect.

## Step 3: Launch the review

Run from the repo root. `-o` makes the CLI itself write the agent's final report to a file (written by the CLI, not the sandboxed agent). The `review` subcommand exposes no `-s` flag — it runs under Codex's default sandbox. Never pass `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` or similar: a reviewer needs no extra access.

```bash
mkdir -p .tmp
codex exec review --base origin/main -m gpt-5.6-sol -c model_reasoning_effort=high -o .tmp/codex-review.md
```

The scope selectors (`--uncommitted`, `--base`, `--commit`) are **mutually exclusive with a custom `[PROMPT]`** — the CLI rejects the combination. Prefer the selector and Codex's built-in review rubric: deterministic scope beats a custom output format, and Step 5/6 normalize the report anyway. Pass custom instructions (as the `[PROMPT]` argument, no selector flag) only when the user asks for a focus the rubric won't cover, and then state the exact diff scope inside the prompt.

High-reasoning review of a real diff runs long — launch it in the background if the runtime supports that; process exit is the completion signal (no polling, no timers). While it runs you may pre-gather verification targets (diff stat, changed files).

## Step 4: Collect

On exit: exit code 0 and `.tmp/codex-review.md` exists non-empty → read it. Nonzero exit or missing/empty file → surface the command's stderr verbatim and stop. Do not fabricate a review, and do not silently rerun (each run burns real subscription tokens — rerun only with the user's OK).

## Step 5: Verify every finding (precision stage)

Cross-vendor does not mean correct — Codex hallucinates too, and it reviewed without this session's context. Before surfacing, run a real check (`grep` call sites, read the cited lines) on **every** finding, all severities. Each one gets:

- **Confirmed** — evidence found, pass it through
- **Refuted** — checked and not real, drop it (optionally note under "checked and fine")
- **Kept with caveat** — one-line note on the residual uncertainty

Drop only on evidence, never because a finding "seems minor". Treat BLOCKING findings adversarially — try to refute each before accepting.

## Step 6: Present

Use the `impartial-review` presentation format: findings severity-ordered globally (🔴 BLOCKING, 🟡 SHOULD-FIX, 🟢 NITPICK), each with `path:line`, concrete description, and a specific fix. Map Codex's native labels onto that scheme during verification (e.g. P1/critical → 🔴, P2/major → 🟡, P3/minor → 🟢), re-ranking where your verification disagrees; then "Things I checked and verified fine" (merge Codex's list with your verification results); then a "Recommendation" that is concrete about merge readiness. Attribute the source: "Codex (gpt-5.6-sol, high reasoning) reviewed <scope>; N of M findings survived verification."

Zero findings from Codex + your spot-check of the highest-risk hunks agrees → say that plainly and recommend merge.

## Common mistakes

| Symptom | Cause → fix |
|---|---|
| `cannot be used with '[PROMPT]'` | scope selector combined with custom instructions → drop one; default to the selector |
| no `.tmp/codex-review.md` after exit 0 | wrong `-o` path or ran from wrong directory → run from repo root, check the path you passed |
| model rejected / unknown | `gpt-5.6-sol` renamed in a newer CLI → drop `-m`/`-c` to inherit the user's `~/.codex/config.toml` defaults, tell the user |
| review of stale diff | `--base` given a local branch name → fetch, then pass `origin/<default-branch>` |
| `windows sandbox: orchestrator_helper_launch_failed` errors in output | standalone Codex CLI release is missing its sandbox helper exes → review still completes but diff-only (no exploration commands); fix by copying `codex-windows-sandbox-setup.exe` and `codex-command-runner.exe` from the Codex desktop app's bin dir into the active `releases/<version>/bin/` dir |
| surprise subscription burn | rerunning or widening scope without asking → one run per request, confirm before rerun |

## Anti-patterns

- Don't pass Codex findings through unverified — Step 5 is the point of running this from Claude at all.
- Don't loosen the sandbox (`-s workspace-write`, bypass flags). The `-o` file needs no write access.
- Don't rerun on failure without surfacing the error and getting an OK — each run costs real subscription tokens.
- Don't present Codex's opinion as ground truth or as your own; attribute it and mark what you confirmed vs. refuted.
- Don't substitute this for `impartial-review` when the user asked for that skill, or vice versa — different independence models (cross-vendor vs. fresh-context multi-agent).
- Don't paste the diff into the prompt — Codex reads the repo itself; the selector flags define the diff.
